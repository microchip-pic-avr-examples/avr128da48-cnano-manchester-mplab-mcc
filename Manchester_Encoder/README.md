 # Manchester Encoder

The Manchester code is a line code in which the encoding of each data bit is either a transition from LOW to HIGH or a transition from HIGH to LOW. It is a self-clocking signal with no DC component.

There are two versions of the Manchester code. This project focuses on the Manchester coding as per IEEE 802.3. The
Manchester code combines data and clock into a single signal, where one clock cycle is a Manchester-bit period. A transition always occurs in the middle of the bit period. Logic `0` is represented by a falling edge (HIGH to LOW transition) in the middle of the bit period, and logic `1` is represented by a rising edge (LOW to HIGH transition) in the middle of the bit period. 

In this application the Manchester communication parameters are: baud rate 16000 bits/s, 8 bit transfer, MSb (Most Signifacnt bit) is sent first, IEEE 802.3. Manchester version (negative edge is binary zero).

An example is presented in the figure below:

This project is an implementation of a Manchester Encoder using CIP (Core Independent Peripherals) by following the interaction between USART, Event System and CCL peripherals. The raw data are received via serial communication, encoded using a circuit composed of the CIP mentioned above and sent further through a single data wire.

The raw data are received via serial communication by the USART1 peripheral. These data are then stored in a buffer and used as input for the USART0 peripheral (configured in SPI mode) which generates NRZ (Non-return-to-zero) data signal and a clock signal. Those signals are selected as inputs for the CCL (Configurable Custom Logic) peripheral which outputs the exclusive or logic operation between the two selected inputs. The XOR operation between the raw data signal and clock represent the Manchester encoded data. A FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffer mechanism is implemented to facilitate the data storage and minimize data loss.
