 # Manchester Decoder

The Manchester code is a line code in which the encoding of each data bit is either a transition from LOW to HIGH or a transition from HIGH to LOW. It is a self-clocking signal with no DC component.

There are two versions of the Manchester code. This project focuses on the Manchester coding as per IEEE 802.3. 
The Manchester code combines data and clock into a single signal, where one clock cycle is a Manchester-bit period. A transition always occurs in the middle of the bit period. Logic `0` is represented by a falling edge (HIGH to LOW transition) in the middle of the bit period, and logic `1` is represented by a rising edge (LOW to HIGH transition) in the middle of the bit period. 

In this application, the Manchester communication parameters are: baud rate 16000 bits/s, 8-bit transfer, MSb (Most Significant bit) is sent first, IEEE 802.3, Manchester version (negative edge is binary zero).

An example is presented in the figure below:

This project is an implementation of a Manchester Decoder using Core Independent Peripherals (CIPs) by following the interaction between TCB, Event System, CCL and SPI peripherals. The encoded data are received through a single data wire. The NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) signal and clock signal are recovered using the circuit composed of the CIP mentioned above. The resulting signals are routed to the SPI peripheral which reads the data. The decoded data are transmitted further via serial communication.

The Manchester encoded signal is received through a single wire. A decoding circuit is implemented using a combination of Configurable Custom Logic blocks and timers. The decoding circuit outputs the recovered NRZ data and a synchronized clock signal that are routed with jumper wires to the SPI1 peripheral configured in Client mode. The SPI1 peripheral will generate interrupts whenever a new byte is received, and the current byte will be stored in a buffer. The data are further transmitted via serial communication (USART1). A time-out mechanism is implement using TCB2 configured in periodic Time-out mode (an interrupt will be generated when no activity occurs on the Manchester data line for the duration of three bytes). A FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffer mechanism is implemented to facilitate the data storage and minimize data loss.

The block diagram of this application is presented in the figure below:
